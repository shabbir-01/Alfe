To use this project with a real video background:

1. Add a video file named 'hero-bg.mp4' to the public folder
2. The video should be:
   - High quality (1920x1080 or higher)
   - Fashion/clothing related content
   - Loopable (seamless loop)
   - Optimized for web (compressed appropriately)
   - Around 15-30 seconds long

Example video sources:
- Pexels.com (free videos)
- Unsplash.com (free videos)  
- Custom fashion photography/videography

The current Hero component has a gradient fallback that will display if no video is found.
